        <h2>What Is Zeta?</h2>
        <p>
            Zeta is a new, modern desktop environment built specifically for ZipperOS. 
            It’s designed to be sleek, fast, customizable, and visually polished, giving users 
            a premium experience beyond what traditional desktop environments provide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zeta focuses on smooth design, transparency effects, modular components, and a layout 
            inspired by the best features of existing Linux desktops—with improvements at nearly 
            every level. It is built to integrate deeply with the core ZipperOS experience.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why Zeta?</h2>
        <p>
            The goal is to move beyond simple desktop themes and create a full environment that 
            defines the identity of ZipperOS—something original, advanced, and built for fans who 
            want more than what traditional desktops offer.
